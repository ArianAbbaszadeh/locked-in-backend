# üîë Last Lock Team 1 - Locked-In

## üìù About

The **Locked-In Backend** serves as the core for processing and identifying room data efficiently. This project is aimed at creating a scalable and reliable backend architecture for handling room-related data. This service is optimized for room identification and processing, providing efficient data handling and API integration, eventually automating geospatial data with computer vision.

## ‚ú® Features

- üåç GeoJson Conversion
- üè† Room Identification
- üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration
- üöÄ Optimized Processes For Faster Execution

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview of How the Code Works
- **Backend**: The backend, developed using Python, serves as the core of the application. It processes uploaded floor plans by utilising image processing techniques via openCV. The extracted room data is stored in a MongoDB database and is accessible through a set of APIs made through FastAPI. These APIs are designed to seamlessly interact with the frontend, ensuring efficient data exchange and integration. Key tasks performed by the backend include: room identification and floor plan segmentation, handling file uploads and processing requests, managing geospatial data conversion to GeoJSON for frontend display.
- **Frontend**: The frontend, built with React and integrated with Mapbox GL JS, provides an intuitive interface for users to organize, upload and resize the processed GeoJSON. The visualisation includes interactive maps making use of Mapbox‚Äôs capabilities to render GeoJSON tilesets.

- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
- Cloudinary account for image management

---

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**: 
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_uri"
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_name"

## ‚úÖ What Works
- Successful room identification and floor plan cropping.
- Seamless integration with MongoDB and Cloudinary for storage.
- API calls for buildings, floors, and coordinates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Doesn‚Äôt
- Small object removal 
- Room identification for small rooms
- Room identification for very large gaps

## üöÄ Future Work
- Implement small object removal
- Implement new parameters and algorithms for more consistent room identification across diverse floorplans
- Speed up text identification algorithm - currently a bottleneck
